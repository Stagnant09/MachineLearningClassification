Classification of objects - Pictures of Cats, Dogs and Wild Animals

In this project, we use a training set of 14630 pictures (512x512, jpg) of cats, dogs and wild animals in order to create a model that can recognize the animals in new images. This model provides a validation set of 1500 pictures.
